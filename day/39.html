<figcaption>I've been following the St Lawrence for days now. It now has gotten very big and changed colour. I like this picture as it has many  different coloured and textured layers.</figcaption>

I was biking hard and fast today and making good progress. I biked past what looked like a brewery/pub where there were many tourists and even bicyclists. I did not stop at all as I wanted to keep biking. However, soon my progress was delayed regardless of my plans as I got a flat.

<figcaption>Rain clouds have been following me all day. Towards the end of the day they caught up to me. I got a little wet and hid the rest of brief rain under the roof of a gas station.</figcaption>

<p>
I was glad to have made it to Trois-Pistoles. I've been noticing a lot of towns with 'Trois' in it.
