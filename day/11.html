<p>
I woke up early and checked the forecast - rain starting in an hour. I packed up quick and by the time I hit the road the rain hit hard. It rained non stop until I got to Brooks 60km over. On the way there I saw and waved at a couple of bicyclists travelling in the opposite direction. I stopped at a Timmies for an hour as I was a little too cold and a little too wet.
</p>

<p>
The rained soon stopped and I continued my way to Medicine Hat. On my way there I got a flat tire. The entire day I battled wind and raced a rain cloud. At Medicine Hat, the city campground was full, but they had an overflow campground which was just a field. The hot shower was one of the best parts of the day!
