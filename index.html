    <h1>Biking across Canada</h1>
<h3>From Vancouver to St John's</h3>

<p>
Hey everybody! This website is currently a work in progress and I will be adding a lot more information. Coding up the website is easy and the main bottleneck here is writing the day entries as I have a few things I am working on right now. I will finish all the day entries (around 50 biking days total) as well as add equipment/expenses info separately. I'll spread most of the bike trip insights throughout the day entries because I think it is the simplest way. The purpose for this website is to inspire people to go on a similar trips and to give information to those already planning a trip. Therefore, to get a lot of the information/insights to plan your trip, you will need to scan through a good chunk of this website(or other similar journal type website). This is something I did myself while planning the trip. Some websites are nice but mostly the links (if you came here from http://www.bikingacrosscanada.ca) are broken or don't have much info. I plan to be one of the good links. For those a little lost as to where to start planning or wondering if their plans are good enough...don't panic it's easier than you think and you don't really need to do much planning (I'll try to leave this impression on the reader throughout my day entries). 
</p>

<p>
But when will I finish all the day entries? Since you won't be starting your bike trip till at least next spring (unless you're biking somewhere near the equator) then I know I have a bit of time :). The minimum rate is posting a new day entry every two days so I will be done in a few months - I currently have a backup of 12 completed days. Now that I have written that last sentence...a few months sounds like an unacceptably long time so I have a compromise: email me a comment/question/requests/suggestions you have on one of the journal day entries or why and where you're planning a trip or just a 'Hello World' to contact AT zonov DOT ca and I'll be encouraged to write more and faster. Encouragement is nice just as a friendly honk from an RV in the middle of Northern Ontario is!
